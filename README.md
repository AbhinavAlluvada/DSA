# LeetCode 150 – C++ Problem Solving

This repository contains my C++ solutions to a curated set of 150 essential LeetCode problems, chosen to build strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and structured problem solving.

It represents a focused transition from learning core concepts to applying them on standard interview-style problems that emphasize efficiency, correctness, and pattern recognition.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Fundamental problem-solving using C++
- Common data structure applications
- Core algorithmic patterns used in interviews
- Efficient use of STL where appropriate
- Gradual exposure to optimized time and space solutions

---

## 🧠 Types of Problems Solved

- Array and string manipulation problems  
- Hashing-based lookup and frequency problems  
- Two-pointer and sliding window techniques  
- Stack and queue based problems  
- Linked list operations and pointer logic  
- Tree traversal and binary tree problems  
- Binary search and search-space reduction problems  
- Recursion fundamentals and backtracking basics  
- Dynamic programming for optimization problems  
- Introductory graph traversal problems  

The problems are selected to strengthen intuition around **when and why** a particular approach or data structure is used.

## 🗂️ Repository Content

- `.cpp` files containing complete C++ solutions  
- Each file focuses on solving a single problem clearly and independently  

The emphasis is on **clear logic and correct implementation**, rather than micro-optimizations or competitive tricks.

---

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **C++ (C++17)**
- STL containers and algorithms
- LeetCode problem platform
- Local compilation and testing
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Build confidence in solving standard DSA problems
- Develop strong algorithmic thinking habits
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Create a solid base for advanced topics such as dynamic programming, graphs, and system design

This repository serves as a **problem-solving archive** and a visible record of steady progress through core DSA concepts.
