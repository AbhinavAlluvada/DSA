# LeetCode 150 – C++ Problem Solving Log

This repository tracks my progress through the first 150 essential LeetCode problems, solved in C++ with a focus on fundamentals, patterns, and clean implementation.

The intent is mastery through reasoning, not speedrunning or leaderboard chasing.

---

## Goals

- Build strong DSA foundations
- Recognize problem-solving patterns
- Write efficient, readable C++ code
- Develop solid time and space complexity intuition
- Prepare for interviews and real-world problem solving

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- Standard: C++17
- Platform: LeetCode
- Editor: VS Code

## Progress Tracker

| # | Problem | Pattern | Status |
|---|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Hashing | ✅ |
| 2 | Valid Anagram | Hashing | ⬜ |
| 3 | Contains Duplicate | Hashing | ⬜ |
| 4 | Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock | Arrays | ⬜ |
| 5 | Valid Parentheses | Stack | ⬜ |

## Rules I Follow

- Start with brute force, then optimize
- No blind copying of solutions
- Every solution must be explainable
- Focus on correctness first, performance second
- Analyze time and space complexity for each solution

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a solution dump
- Not a competitive speedrun
- Not optimized for “0 ms” vanity metrics

---

## Outcome

After completing these 150 problems, I aim to:
- Instantly identify standard patterns
- Confidently derive optimal solutions
- Be fully interview-ready
- Move into advanced DSA, system design, and large-scale problem solving

Status: In progress  
Consistency beats intensity.
